            "description": "<p>Most American corporations currently face six major opportunities for increasing productivity and profits. All six of these opportunities depend on new information systems and all are threatened by cybersecurity issues. CIOs that can get past these cybersecurity issues sooner can help their companies reap the rewards of these business opportunities, with potential results including considerably greater earnings or lower costs. This talk outlines the six business opportunities, as well as two others that are a little less immediate, and explains how cybersecurity can be a tool for taking advantage of them.</p>",

Borg is also an advisor on cybersecurity to the EU and maintains close relations with policy makers in several NATO countries. </p><p>Borg&rsquo;s record for anticipating new cybersecurity developments is probably unequaled. He publicly predicted Stuxnet, including all of its main features, its exact target, and how it would damage that target 14 months before it was discovered. </p><p>Borg has written extensively on cybersecurity and has delivered more than 100 speeches at conventions, conferences and technical briefings. He has been a guest lecturer at leading universities, is regularly quoted in most of the leading newspapers in the U.S. and Britain, and comments regularly on cybersecurity for major broadcast networks. In collaboration with his US-CCU colleagues, Borg offers courses in cyber threat analysis, cyber consequence analysis, and cyber vulnerability analysis.</p>",
