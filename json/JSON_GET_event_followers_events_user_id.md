When malware strikes, the threat is contained in a micro-VM and is not able to steal or damage any enterprise resource. vSentry is transparent to the end user, has no impact on user experience or performance, and empowers the user to click without fear. Bromium LAVA works with vSentry to automatically record an entire attack within the isolated micro-VM. It is then forwarded to the central LAVA console, providing security teams with automatic, in-depth analysis of advanced malware.</p>",
