Borg is widely regarded as the leading authority on the economics of cybersecurity.</p><p>Borg has testified before the U.S. Senate, was a member of the Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th presidency, and has served on many other advisory bodies. Borg is also an advisor on cybersecurity to the EU and maintains close relations with policy makers in several NATO countries. </p><p>Borg&rsquo;s record for anticipating new cybersecurity developments is probably unequaled. He publicly predicted Stuxnet, including all of its main features, its exact target, and how it would damage that target 14 months before it was discovered. </p><p>Borg has written extensively on cybersecurity and has delivered more than 100 speeches at conventions, conferences and technical briefings. He has been a guest lecturer at leading universities, is regularly quoted in most of the leading newspapers in the U.S. and Britain, and comments regularly on cybersecurity for major broadcast networks. In collaboration with his US-CCU colleagues, Borg offers courses in cyber threat analysis, cyber consequence analysis, and cyber vulnerability analysis.</p>",
