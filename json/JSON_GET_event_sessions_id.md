        "description": "<p>IT organizations today are far more than a collection of best practices and technology integration projects. They serve as business innovators, consultants and analysts. With the increase of cloud-based services offered through various deployment models, IT must now also evolve to become an aggregator of these services to make the greatest impact to the organization. Whether this function is in-house or outsourced, this service will become a vital aspect of IT as cloud, analytics, mobile and social gain steam. This discussion centers on the requirements and strategies that organizations are employing to bridge the gap.</p>",
