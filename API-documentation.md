The types of API routes available can generally be broken up into seven different categories:

* [App & Navigation](/Evanta/EvantaAccessAPI/wiki/App-&-Navigation))
* Banner Ads
* Events
* Groups
* Messages
* Posts
* Users

Possibly using this as a template: http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/API_Reference_Template

Would eventually like to look like Twitter's: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1
